# procedural-geo

This project is a development sandbox I am using to test procedural geometry in Godot. Later, I would like to evolve this into a simple geometry modeling tool for Godot. I also intend to experiment with using node-based UI for creating procedural geometry.

The development roadmap and other notes are inside of the [/docs](./docs/) folder.
